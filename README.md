Our Project Idea: Parking Lot IOT

https://github.com/DMD-Code-Fellows/Parking-IOT

It's a hardware/software product that will allow users to discover available parking spaces in a parking lot, thereby saving time, and fuel. Sensors in each parking space automatically mark spaces as available, or unavailable, as drivers take, or leave them.

The hardware part of this product will utilize Raspberry Pi micro computers, programmed to detect a sensor being triggered, and respond by contacting our new API.

The software part of the product consists of our new API, an underlying database to store current parking lot information, and a parking lot attendant monitor.

The API will allow drivers to get information about available parking spaces, and respond to Raspberry Pi sensor state changes, in order to update the database.

The attendants monitor will display an up to date status of the parking lot's spaces, together with parking space transactions.
