##Communication plan: 

We will use slack for the majority of our communication. Also, we have one another's phone number. We also already laid out our set time blocks and future potential time blocks. 

##Conflict plan: 

We have open communication, any sort of conflict discussion must be open and have input from each member on an equal share process.

##Work plan: 

We are heavily utilizing the project management feature in Github

##Git process: 

We will never directly merge into the master branch. We will have two underneath parallel branches "staging" and "integration". master is merged from "staging". "staging" - is merged from integration "integration" is merged from the individual working task branch.
